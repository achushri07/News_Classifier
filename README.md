# AI News Classifier 📰

An intelligent web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles into their respective categories: **Tech, Business, Sport, Entertainment, and Politics**.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **Real-time Classification**: Instantly categorizes any news article pasted into the web interface.
-   **NLP-Powered Engine**: Utilizes sophisticated NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
-   **Machine Learning Model**: Employs a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the well-known BBC News dataset.
-   **Interactive UI**: A sleek and modern user interface built with Flask and Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Concepts

-   **Backend**: **Python**, **Flask**
-   **Machine Learning**: **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NLTK**
-   **Frontend**: **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**
-   **Core NLP Concepts**:
    -   **Text Preprocessing**: Implemented techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and Porter Stemming to clean and prepare the textual data.
    -   **Feature Extraction**: Used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert the processed text into meaningful numerical vectors that the machine learning model can understand. This technique helps in highlighting words that are more important to a specific document.
