# AI News Classifier 📰

An intelligent web application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles into their respective categories: **Tech, Business, Sport, Entertainment, and Politics**.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **Real-time Classification**: Instantly categorizes any news article pasted into the web interface.
-   **NLP-Powered Engine**: Utilizes sophisticated NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
-   **Machine Learning Model**: Employs a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the well-known BBC News dataset.
-   **Interactive UI**: A sleek and modern user interface built with Flask and Tailwind CSS.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Concepts

-   **Backend**: **Python**, **Flask**
-   **Machine Learning**: **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NLTK**
-   **Frontend**: **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**
-   **Core NLP Concepts**:
    -   **Text Preprocessing**: Implemented techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and Porter Stemming to clean and prepare the textual data.
    -   **Feature Extraction**: Used **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to convert the processed text into meaningful numerical vectors that the machine learning model can understand. This technique helps in highlighting words that are more important to a specific document.

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/news-classifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/news-classifier.git)
cd news-classifier
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment:**
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**3. Install the required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*This will also download necessary NLTK data like 'stopwords' and 'punkt'.*

**4. Generate the Model File:**
- Open and run all the cells in the **`model.ipynb`** Jupyter Notebook.
- This will process the `bbc-text.csv` dataset and create two essential files: `vectorizer.pkl` and `model.pkl`.

**5. Run the Flask Application:**
```bash
python app.py
```

**6. Open your browser:**
- Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the application live!
